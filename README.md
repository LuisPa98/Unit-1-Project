# The Solar System

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to type the name of any of the 9 planets in the solar system, and get the Date of discovery, number of moons, etc from a API (linked on this about me). When you're on the planet page you can use the navigation bar (via click) to go to that planet's page and get the same information.

## MVP 
The mininum I needed to have on this project was to use the technology listed here.<br>
Technology used: HTML , CSS, Javascript <br>
Have to use at least one API to grab data from, use either flexbox, or grid CSS. Implemented at least three responsive design including desktop, tablet, and phone. Finally host my project on github pages.

## Post MVP
I will plan to design the project with more creative and complex design using CSS (make nav bar have a indicator, animation on planets, etc), use more than one API to grab additional information outside of the solar system.
